# Discrete Climate Scenarios

Discrete Climate Scenarios is a Python repository designed to facilitate the download, processing, and bias adjustment of CMIP6 climate scenario data for individual weather station locations. This repository provides tools to streamline the retrieval of climate data and prepare it for further analysis at specific geographic locations.

## Features

- **Data Download**: Automatically fetches CMIP6 climate scenario data from Google Earth Engine for user-specified time periods.
- **Data Processing**: Filters, cleans, and preprocesses the downloaded climate data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Bias Adjustment**: Implements scaled distribution mapping for bias adjustment between observed and modeled climate data.
- **Station-Specific Analysis**: Generates climate scenarios tailored to individual weather station locations, allowing for localized climate analysis and impact assessments.
- **Visualizations**: Creates figures to assess impact and performance of the bias adjustment
